# Expts descriptions and detailed configurations.

## Testing availability of HadCM3 using old data

A set of experiments were carried out following the configurations of Chris' xpza.

This is a straight copy from xpuoo.

Copied from xpzab, control run of `xpza`.  
> `xpzab`: Spin-up ii. Dynamic TRIFFID. 200 years to finish spin-up. After this check veg frac, carbon stores and ocean fluxes are in steady state. Copy from xpzaa, but turn to dyn triffid (10-day period), and edit a few diags. TRIFFID profile set to 480 timesteps. **Plan to leave this going as a control run, and start point for subsequent runs.**
>
>> `xpzaa`: Spin-up, equilibrium TRIFFID. 40 years, 8*5 TRIF periods. Copy from xpwca, but largely doesn't matter. Can go from any start dump. Differences below are from Paul's tfita.
>>
>>> `tfita`: UTOPIA advection on all tracers. This is near final retuning setup. Tuned surface NPP and deep ocean oxygen. This uses remin_temp_depend_05a. run for 3000 years.
