# Notes on cmip6 emissions data

# scripts overview
- cartopy_tutorial.ipynb

This is mainly for learning how to use cartopy.  

- create_animation.ipynb

This is the main place where we produce, test our figures.

- create_animation.py

This is a versatile py script we hope is as portable as possible, but needs some work.
  
# Updates
- updates on 3rdMar2025  
Note we've recently moved raw emissions data and animation outputs to another folder,
`~20983/ancil/cmip7/new_emissions`
Thus, be careful in the locations when applying scripts here to extract data from those files and to produce processed files.

- updates on 7thMar2025  
Work mainly done on the local, modified the `create_animation.ipynb`, to give the most current monthly time series of historical emissions.
